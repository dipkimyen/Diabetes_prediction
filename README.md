## Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early prediction and diagnosis can significantly improve the management and outcome of the disease. This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on various medical attributes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. It includes the following features:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age
- Outcome (target variable: 0 for non-diabetic, 1 for diabetic)

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter

## Usage

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dipkimyen/Diabetes_prediction.git

Navigate to the project directory:

'''bash
cd Diabetes_prediction

Open the Jupyter Notebook:
'''bash
jupyter notebook

Open the Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb notebook and run the cells to see the data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

##Models
The project explores several machine learning models, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Each model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

##Results
The results of the model evaluations are summarized in the notebook. The best-performing model is selected based on its performance metrics.
